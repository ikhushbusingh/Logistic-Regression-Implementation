Objective: Implement logistic regression for a binary classification problem, such as predicting customer churn or loan default, using Python and relevant libraries.

Method: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Implement logistic regression using libraries like scikit-learn, train the model on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: The logistic regression implementation provides a predictive model that can be deployed for real-world applications, aiding in decision-making processes and improving outcomes in binary classification tasks.
